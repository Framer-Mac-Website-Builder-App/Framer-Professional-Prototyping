Unlike traditional design tools, Framer bridges the gap between design and development.

This makes it an ideal choice for creating complex user interfaces, micro-interactions, and immersive web experiences.

Framer supports real-time collaboration, enabling distributed teams to work together seamlessly. Its intuitive interface reduces the learning curve, while its powerful capabilities satisfy the needs of experienced designers and developers alike. Whether you're working on a startup project or an enterprise application, Framer provides the flexibility and control required to deliver exceptional digital products.

The tool is optimized for performance on all Mac devices, including those with Apple Silicon chips, and integrates smoothly with macOS features like Dark Mode and Retina displays.
